#statement:Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of studing hours using linear regression


#importing the required libraries

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import linear_model

import numpy as np
import seaborn as sb

data

#spliting the data from dataframe

x=data['Hours'].values
y=data['Scores'].values


# Formula for linear regression equation is given by:

# y=a+bx
# a and b are given by the following formulas:

#a (intercept)=∑y∑x2–∑x∑xy(∑x2)–(∑x)2
 

# b(slope)=n∑xy−(∑x)(∑y)n∑x2−(∑x)2
# Where,
# x and y are two variables on the regression line.
# b = Slope of the line.
# a = y-intercept of the line.
# x = Values of the first data set.
# y = Values of the second data set.



# finding the mean values for the given data

mean_x=np.mean(x)
mean_y=np.mean(y)


#to find the no of data present in the  frame

n=len(x)


numer=0
denom=0

# predicting the values by using Least-Squares Regression formula 
# calculating the values 

for i in range(n):
       numer+= (x[i] - mean_x)* (y[i] - mean_y )
       denom+= (x[i] - mean_x)**2 

b1= numer/denom
b0= mean_y - (b1 * mean_x)

print(b1,b0)

# predicting the percentage the student studied for 9.25 hours
predict_hours=9.25
answer= b0 + b1*predict_hours
print("The study studied for 9.25 hours will score:",answer,"percentage in exam")


#plotting the regression line 
sb.regplot(x = "Hours", 
            y = "Scores",  
            ci = None, 
            data = data)
